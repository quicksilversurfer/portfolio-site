Rather than supporting a person in simply finding something, Map.it tries to intelligently suggest. Optimizing routes for people, helping them become more productive, efficient and aware of their surroundings and the possibilities that their cities offer.</p>\n    <p>Users get appropriate solutions, optimized in a way that fits their schedule. Businesses have a chance to target a primed and distributed audience with a higher success rate for conversion. And for cities, a place to showcase it's rich history, culture and the interests of it's residents.</p>\n  </PostUnit>\n\n  <PostShowcase>\n    <ProjectCard\n      link=\"/draw-me-a-story/\"\n
