Concepts are ideas and a collection of artwork based around a theme, anything from general topics like nature, moods and social issues to private topics like personal events.</p>\n    <p>Vibhu, the founder, approached me initially to update the current design, since Concept Nation had been up for some time and was getting some traction. There were also issues with users understanding the value proposition of the platform which he also wanted to address.</p>\n  </PostUnit>\n\n  <Blockquote>The goal was to further develop the MVP, setting up a foundation for further explorations and understand where the real value of the platform lay.</Blockquote>\n\n  <PostUnit title=\"Diverging\">\n    <p>We started by identifying the strengths of both Kobalt and Love Therapy in order to plot out opportunities that can be explored by their collaboration.</p>\n  </PostUnit>\n\n  <Content>\n    <ImageCont size=\"6\" src={props.data.analytics.childImageSharp.fluid} caption=\"Concept Nation Analytics - Audience Duration Times\" border=\"true\"></ImageCont>\n  </Content>\n\n  <PostUnit>\n    <p><b>Lots of drop offs from the landing page - </b>Call to Actions weren't strong enough or the page wasn't engaging for the user.</p>\n    <p><b>High drop offs from the shop page - </b>People did not understand the associated social platform.</p>\n    <p><b>Less than 1 % of users were creating concepts - </b>Lack of clarity about how the platform worked.</p>\n    <p><b>Primarily referral traffic - </b>Users were engaging on social platforms, and were coming in directly to internal pages.</p>\n    <p><b>Users voted Artwork - </b>Users engaged with interactions they understood.</p>\n    <p><b>Users following Artists - </b>Users engaged with interactions they understood.</p>\n  </PostUnit>\n\n  <Content>\n    <ImageCont size=\"3\" src={props.data.prev1.childImageSharp.fluid} caption=\"Original Landing Page\" border=\"true\"></ImageCont>\n    <ImageCont size=\"3\" src={props.data.prev2.childImageSharp.fluid} caption=\"Orginal Artwork Listing Page\" border=\"true\"></ImageCont>\n    <ImageCont size=\"3\" src={props.data.prev3.childImageSharp.fluid} caption=\"Orginal Shop Page\" border=\"true\"></ImageCont>\n  </Content>\n\n  <PostUnit>\n    <p>I also did an assessment of the current design to become familiar with the UI and information architecture to identify areas where we could quickly improve upon. I identified the following areas which needed to be tackled -</p>\n    <p><b>Create navigational structures</b>that help the user identify content (concept vs. artwork) and understand where they are in the platform.</p>\n    <p><b>Create a consistent and scalable visual language</b> by harmonizing the layout, the use of color, typography.</p>\n    <p>Lastly, <b>allow for serendipitous discovery</b>by showcasing relevant content at the right places in a user's journey.</p>\n  </PostUnit>\n\n  <PostUnit title=\"Building\">\n    <p>Understanding that we wanted to communicate the platforms mission to the audience, I developed some wireframes to communicate my approach to Vibhu and soon after started building. We performed some quick iterations on the visual design and had something that we were satisfied with quite early.</p>\n    <p>I built the application using Bootstrap framework, as it was the most updated and modern web framework at the time.
