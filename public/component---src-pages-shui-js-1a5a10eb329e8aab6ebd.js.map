With several products in each of these categories, supporting multiple user profiles, use cases and interaction mediums, creating a cohesive design system that can be applied at scale is a complex problem.   \n    </p>\n  </PostUnit>\n\n  <Blockquote>\n    The challenge with SHUI is to create a design system that can span different product classes, support multiple clients from desktop to in-built interfaces on hardware, and be easy to apply for complex and critical work environments. \n  </Blockquote>\n\n  <PostUnit border=\"true\">\n    <p>\n      I am part of a small design team working towards scaling the design system to cover use cases for existing flagship products and products that are planned to roll out in the future. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Being part of this project since it's conception, it's been a great growth opportunity for me with respect to thinking about visual design systems at scale, deeper understanding of the organization and how it is structured, and the workflows and use cases of some of our key products and services. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      After the initial release of the project internally, we were validated that this was a step in the right direction when SHUI received the <a href=\"https://www.red-dot.org/project/shui-siemens-healthineers-user-interface-25965\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">'Communication Design'</a> award from Red Dot in 2018.\n    </p>\n  </PostUnit>\n\n  <PostShowcase>\n    <ProjectCard\n      link=\"/ultrasound/\"\n      projectCover={props.data.ultrasound.childImageSharp.fluid}\n      projectTitle=\"Ultrasound\"\n      projectDesc=\"End to end design execution for a complex medical device.\"\n    ></ProjectCard>   \n    <ProjectCard\n      link=\"/draw-me-a-story/\"\n      projectCover={props.data.noldor.childImageSharp.fluid}\n      projectTitle=\"Draw me a story\"\n      projectDesc=\"Interactive storytelling experience for children.\"\n    ></ProjectCard>\n  </PostShowcase>\n\n\n  \n</Frame>\n\n\n)\n\nexport default Shui\n\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\nquery  {\n  cover: file(relativePath: { eq: \"assets/images/fractalink/eezyrent.jpg\" }) {\n    childImageSharp {\n      fluid(maxWidth: 1226) {\n        ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  profile: file(relativePath: { eq: \"assets/images/fractalink/eezyrent-profile.jpg\" }) {\n      childImageSharp {\n        fluid(maxWidth: 1226) {\n          ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ultrasound: file(relativePath: { eq: \"assets/images/ultrasound.png\" }) {\n    childImageSharp {\n        fluid(maxWidth: 1226) {\n        ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  noldor: file(relativePath: { eq: \"assets/images/noldor_cover.png\" }) {\n    childImageSharp {\n        fluid(maxWidth: 1226) {\n        ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n        }\n        }\n    }\n}\n`"],"sourceRoot":""}
