The experience of working through the entire design process for such a complex medical device, by being deeply integrated with the product team, was an immensely enriching experience. It revealed the underlying complexity of what it takes to bring a medical device to market.\n    </p>\n  </PostUnit>\n\n  <Blockquote>As a redesign of an existing system, there were two major challenges - one, understanding what already existed in the system, how people used it and why, and the second, how we could re-envision the experience to serve the current and future needs of our customers.</Blockquote>\n\n  <PostUnit border=\"true\">\n    <p>\n      Fresh out of school, and no clinical background whatsoever, the challenge was a tall order. We compensated for our lack of domain knowledge by relying on our design toolbox and sheer hard work. Together we conducted several research and evaluation sessions with physicians, sonographers and technologists around the world, focused on US, Germany and China, to learn about their workflows, their contexts, needs, likes and dislikes. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      All the hard work has paid off, the ACUSON Sequoia has gone on to win the <a href=\"https://www.red-dot.org/project/acuson-sequoia-39373\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Red Dot Award in 2019</a> for 'Product Design' and in an independent study by <a href=\"https://www.macadamian.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Macadamian</a>, a design consultancy, the system scored an 'A' grade System Usability Score (SUS) of 86, significantly better than the main competitors, along with reduced task time and higher ease of use ratings against comparable systems.\n    </p>\n  </PostUnit>\n\n  <PostShowcase>\n    <ProjectCard\n      link=\"/shui/\"\n      projectCover={props.data.shui.childImageSharp.fluid}\n      projectTitle=\"Shui\"\n      projectDesc=\"Developing design systems for increased internal productivity and user interface consistency.\"\n    ></ProjectCard>      \n    <ProjectCard\n      link=\"/draw-me-a-story/\"\n      projectCover={props.data.noldor.childImageSharp.fluid}\n      projectTitle=\"Draw me a story\"\n      projectDesc=\"Interactive storytelling experience for children.\"\n    ></ProjectCard>\n  </PostShowcase>\n\n\n  \n</Frame>\n\n\n)\n\nexport default Ultrasound\n\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\nquery  {\n  cover: file(relativePath: { eq: \"assets/images/fractalink/eezyrent.jpg\" }) {\n    childImageSharp {\n      fluid(maxWidth: 1226) {\n        ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  profile: file(relativePath: { eq: \"assets/images/fractalink/eezyrent-profile.jpg\" }) {\n      childImageSharp {\n        fluid(maxWidth: 1226) {\n          ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  shui: file(relativePath: { eq: \"assets/images/shui-cover.png\" }) {\n    childImageSharp {\n        fluid(maxWidth: 1226) {\n        ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n        }\n        }\n    }\n  noldor: file(relativePath: { eq: \"assets/images/noldor_cover.png\" }) {\n    childImageSharp {\n        fluid(maxWidth: 1226) {\n        ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n        }\n        }\n    }\n}\n`"],"sourceRoot":""}
